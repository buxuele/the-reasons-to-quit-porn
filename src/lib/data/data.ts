    "content_cn": "最近又有戒友在说，既然戒色，那么就不看黄色的，看清纯的。看清纯的总归无害吧，这种论调，我记得一年前就有戒友提到过，他搜集了一大堆的清纯照片，不是黄色的，但他后来看着看着就想歪了，然后就破戒了。只要面对女色，不管是诱惑的还是清纯的，都是有可能起邪念的。而且清纯的杀伤力更强，隐蔽性更高，很容易失去警惕，让心魔钻了空子。清纯是心魔的另一种诱饵，只是换个口味钓你上钩，心魔的诱饵有2种口味，一种诱惑的，一种清纯的。",
    "content_en": "Recently, some people say that while abstaining, they should look at 'pure' images instead of pornography. I remember a person who collected many 'pure' photos, but eventually, his thoughts strayed and he relapsed. Whether seductive or pure, any focus on female beauty can trigger evil thoughts. In fact, 'purity' can be more dangerous due to its hidden nature, making you lower your guard. Purity is just another bait of the heart-demon, just a different flavor to hook you."
